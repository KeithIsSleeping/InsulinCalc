Insulin Calculator helps people with diabetes quickly calculate insulin doses based on carbohydrate intake and blood glucose readings.

Built by a parent of a child with Type 1 diabetes, this app was designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use — especially during the busy moments when you need it most.

★ KEY FEATURES

▸ Carb Dose Calculation
Enter the carbs you plan to eat and your insulin-to-carb ratio. The app instantly calculates how many units of insulin you need.

▸ Correction Dose Calculation
Enter your current glucose reading, correction factor, and target. The app calculates the correction dose needed to bring your glucose back to target.

▸ Dexcom CGM Trend Support
Select your current CGM trend arrow (from ↑↑ rapidly rising to ↓↓ rapidly falling) to factor glucose trends into your dose calculation. Supports both mg/dL and mmol/L adjustments.

▸ Multiple Profiles
Create profiles for different times of day — breakfast, lunch, dinner, or anything else. Set carb ratio, correction factor, and target for each profile. Profiles can switch automatically on a 24-hour schedule or be selected manually.

▸ 24-Hour Schedule
Assign profiles to time ranges so the correct ratios are loaded automatically throughout the day.

▸ Configurable Dose Rounding
Round doses to 1 unit, 0.5 unit, 0.1 unit, or 0.05 unit increments to match your insulin pen or pump precision.

▸ mg/dL and mmol/L Support
Switch between glucose units at any time. All values and trend adjustments update automatically.

▸ Dark & Light Themes
Choose between dark mode, light mode, or auto (follows your system setting).

▸ Privacy First
No accounts. No data collection. No internet required. All your data stays on your device.
